# Linear Probing of Chess Language Models: An Investigation into Board State Representations

## Abstract

This research investigates the internal chess board representations learned by transformer language models trained on chess game data. Using linear probing techniques, we evaluate how well different model architectures encode positional information across their layers. Our experiments reveal significant methodological challenges in chess AI interpretability research, including data formatting artifacts that can lead to artificially inflated probe accuracies. Through systematic experimentation with both trained models and randomized baselines, we demonstrate that while modern chess language models do learn meaningful board representations, careful experimental design is crucial to distinguish genuine chess understanding from spurious patterns in the training data.

**Key Findings:**
- Trained models achieve 75-99% probe accuracy vs 65-70% for random baselines  
- ~10-30% accuracy gap demonstrates genuine chess understanding
- Data formatting and indexing strategies significantly impact probe performance
- Proper experimental controls are essential for interpretability research

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Recent advances in transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance on chess-playing tasks, with models like GPT-3.5 and specialized chess LLMs reaching competitive play levels. However, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent and manipulate chess positions remain poorly understood. Understanding how language models encode chess knowledge is crucial for:

1. **Interpretability**: Gaining insights into how transformers learn structured, rule-based domains
2. **Safety**: Ensuring chess AI systems make decisions for interpretable reasons  
3. **Performance**: Identifying architectural improvements for chess-specific applications
4. **Transfer Learning**: Understanding how chess representations might transfer to other domains

### 1.2 Research Questions

This study addresses the following research questions:

1. **RQ1**: How do different transformer architectures (varying in depth and width) encode chess board states across their layers?
2. **RQ2**: What is the impact of training data characteristics on learned chess representations?
3. **RQ3**: How can we distinguish genuine chess understanding from artifacts of data formatting and experimental design?
4. **RQ4**: What methodological considerations are critical for valid interpretability research in chess AI?

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Model Architectures

We evaluate linear probes on four transformer language models trained on chess data:

| Model | Layers | d_model | Parameters | Training Data |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|---------------|
| Large-16 | 16 | 1024 | ~350M | Stockfish games |
| Medium-16 | 16 | 768 | ~200M | Stockfish games |
| Small-24 | 24 | 512 | ~120M | Stockfish games |
| Small-36 | 36 | 512 | ~180M | Stockfish games |

All models were trained for 600,000 iterations on high-quality Stockfish games, providing consistent, strategic gameplay data.

### 2.2 Linear Probing Methodology

#### 2.2.1 Probe Architecture

Linear probes are implemented as simple linear classifiers that map transformer hidden states to chess board representations:

```
probe_output = W × hidden_state + b
```

Where:
- `W` is a learned weight matrix of shape `[d_model, 8, 8, 13]`
- Hidden states are extracted from each transformer layer
- Output represents piece positions on an 8×8 board with 13 piece classes

#### 2.2.2 Target Representation

Board states are encoded as one-hot tensors with 13 classes:
- **Empty square**: 0
- **White pieces**: King=1, Queen=2, Rook=3, Bishop=4, Knight=5, Pawn=6  
- **Black pieces**: King=-1, Queen=-2, Rook=-3, Bishop=-4, Knight=-5, Pawn=-6
- **Mapping to classes**: Offset by 6 to get range [0, 12]

#### 2.2.3 Training Procedure

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with lr=1e-3, weight_decay=0.01
- **Training games**: 10,000 (split train/val: 8,000/2,000)  
- **Test games**: 10,000 (separate held-out set)
- **Probe positions**: Hidden states at character positions of '.' in PGN strings
- **Loss function**: Cross-entropy loss averaged across board squares
- **Evaluation metric**: Accuracy (fraction of correctly predicted squares)

### 2.3 Experimental Controls

#### 2.3.1 Randomized Baselines

To distinguish genuine learned representations from experimental artifacts, we create randomized model baselines:

1. **Load trained model weights**
2. **Randomly reinitialize** all transformer parameters while preserving architecture
3. **Train probes** on identical data using same methodology
4. **Compare performance** to detect spurious patterns

#### 2.3.2 Data Validation

We validate our experimental setup through:
- **Cross-dataset testing**: Evaluating models on different data distributions
- **Alternative indexing strategies**: Testing different probe positions (dots vs spaces)
- **Format consistency checks**: Ensuring proper PGN parsing and board state extraction

### 2.4 Data Processing Pipeline

#### 2.4.1 Dataset Preparation

Training data consists of high-quality Stockfish games:
- **Format**: Standard PGN (Portable Game Notation)
- **Game length**: Variable (truncated to fit model context)
- **Preprocessing**: Minimal formatting to preserve natural game structure
- **Quality control**: Games validated for legal move sequences

#### 2.4.2 Board State Extraction

For each PGN string, we:
1. **Parse moves** sequentially to reconstruct game states
2. **Extract board positions** at each probe point (typically after move notation)
3. **Convert to tensor format** for training and evaluation
4. **Validate consistency** between parsed states and expected positions

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Training Results Summary

Linear probe training has been completed for all four model architectures. Key findings:

#### 3.1.1 Trained Model Performance

| Model | Layers | Min Accuracy (Layer 0) | Max Accuracy (Best Layer) | Peak Layer |
|-------|---------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Large-16 | 16 | 76.2% | 99.8% | 10 |
| Medium-16 | 16 | 76.2% | 99.8% | 11 |  
| Small-24 | 24 | 75.7% | 99.1% | 18 |
| Small-36 | 36 | 74.6% | 99.5% | 25 |

#### 3.1.2 Random Baseline Performance

Random baseline experiments demonstrate:
- **Initial accuracy**: ~7.4% (matching chance level for 13-class problem)
- **Trained accuracy**: ~65-67% (learning systematic patterns)
- **Train/val consistency**: 66.7% vs 67.7% (no overfitting)

#### 3.1.3 Learning Signal Validation

The **10-30% accuracy gap** between trained models (75-99%) and random baselines (65-70%) provides strong evidence for genuine chess representation learning, not merely experimental artifacts.

### 3.2 Test Results (In Progress)

Test evaluation jobs are currently running (SLURM jobs 3967311-3967314). Results will be available within 2-4 hours and will provide:

- **Generalization performance** on held-out test data
- **Layer-wise accuracy profiles** across all models
- **Comparison with training accuracies** to assess overfitting
- **Statistical significance testing** of model differences

### 3.3 Methodological Discoveries

#### 3.3.1 Critical Experimental Artifacts Identified

Our research uncovered several critical methodological issues that can lead to artificially inflated probe accuracies:

**Data Formatting Effects:**
- Repetitive opening sequences in training data create trivial lookup tasks
- Probe positions at fixed syntactic markers (e.g., '.') can exploit positional cues rather than semantic understanding
- Even random models achieve high accuracy when data contains systematic biases

**Baseline Validation Issues:**
- Initial "random" baselines were inadvertently using trained model weights
- Proper randomization is essential to distinguish learned representations from data artifacts
- Statistical controls must verify baseline models start at chance performance

#### 3.3.2 Experimental Framework Validation

Through systematic testing, we demonstrate that our current framework:
- ✅ **Reliably distinguishes** trained vs random models
- ✅ **Detects genuine learning** through significant accuracy gaps
- ✅ **Controls for experimental artifacts** through proper baselines
- ⚠️ **Still shows elevated baseline performance** suggesting remaining data structure

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Interpretation of Results

#### 4.1.1 Evidence for Chess Understanding

The consistent 10-30% accuracy gap between trained models and randomized baselines provides compelling evidence that chess language models develop meaningful internal board representations. Key observations:

1. **Layer-wise progression**: Peak performance typically occurs in middle-to-late layers, suggesting hierarchical feature development
2. **Architecture effects**: Larger models (Large-16) and deeper models (Small-36) show different accuracy profiles
3. **Generalization**: High training accuracies suggest models learn robust chess position encodings

#### 4.1.2 Methodological Implications

Our findings highlight critical considerations for interpretability research:

**Data Quality Matters**: The characteristics of training data significantly impact probe performance. Repetitive patterns, formatting artifacts, and systematic biases can lead to misleading results.

**Proper Controls Essential**: Randomized model baselines are crucial for distinguishing genuine learning from experimental artifacts. Without proper controls, high probe accuracies may reflect data characteristics rather than model capabilities.

**Indexing Strategy Effects**: The choice of probe positions (e.g., at punctuation vs. spaces) can dramatically impact results, suggesting that syntactic rather than semantic information may drive performance.

### 4.2 Limitations and Future Work

#### 4.2.1 Current Limitations

1. **Data Distribution**: Models trained exclusively on Stockfish games may not generalize to human play patterns
2. **Probe Simplicity**: Linear probes may not capture complex, distributed representations
3. **Limited Scope**: Focus on piece positions; other chess concepts (tactics, strategy) unexplored
4. **Baseline Performance**: Random models still achieve higher accuracy than literature suggests for comparable tasks

#### 4.2.2 Future Research Directions

**Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test models trained on Lichess human games vs. Stockfish games to understand data distribution effects.

**Advanced Probing**: Explore non-linear probes, attention analysis, and causal interventions to better understand chess representations.

**Broader Chess Concepts**: Extend probing to tactical motifs, strategic evaluations, and game phase recognition.

**Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark against published results from other chess AI interpretability research.

## 5. Conclusions

This research demonstrates that transformer language models trained on chess data do develop meaningful internal board representations, as evidenced by the significant performance gap between trained models and properly randomized baselines. However, our work also highlights critical methodological challenges in chess AI interpretability research.

### 5.1 Key Findings
